How to use Using the extension in WSO2 Stream Processor You can use this extension in the latest WSO2 Stream Processor that is a part of WSO2 Analytics offering, with editor, debugger and simulation support. This extension is shipped by default with WSO2 Stream Processor, if you wish to use an alternative version of this extension you can replace the component jar that can be found in the STREAM_PROCESSOR_HOME /lib directory. Using the extension as a java library This extension can be added as a maven dependency along with other Siddhi dependencies to your project. dependency groupId org.wso2.extension.siddhi.map.avro /groupId artifactId siddhi-map-avro /artifactId version x.x.x /version /dependency Jenkins Build Status Branch Build Status master Features avro (Sink Mapper) This extension is a Siddhi Event to Avro Message output mapper.Transports that publish messages to Avro sink can utilize this extension to convert siddhi events to Avro messages. Users can either specify the avro schema or give the schema registry URL and schema reference id as a parameter in stream definition. In case no specification of avro schema a flat avro schema of type record is generated using the stream attributes as schema fields. avro (Source Mapper) Avro to Event input mapper.
